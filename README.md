### What I learned

I learned how to style the counters or bullets using the `marker` modifier in Tailwind CSS.

### Continued development

When I decided to build this project, I was going to use HTML and CSS but I couldn't wtite good CSS class names. So, I used Tailwind CSS and probably going to use it in future projects as well.

### Useful resource

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Tailwind CSS Docs
